* deployed the web below using fastly-test-blog page

    https://blog-fastly.herokuapp.com

* create new service 

    server address : https://blog-fastly.herokuapp.com
    domain name:   blog-fastly.herokuapp.com

    (don't add / at the end)
    (port 80 - non SSL)

* test URL: Testing setup before changing domains
    After you deploy your service, 
    but before you change your DNS entries to send your domain to our servers, 
    you can check to see how your service is pulled through the network.

    * Test case 1 : use Web UI - click configure then 
        click "Test the domain" to see how your service is being pulled through the network. 
    
    * Test case 2: using command line
    
        * Determining the IP address of a Fastly POP

            $ dig nonssl.global.fastly.net
            // as mac doesn't have nslookup

                run below 
                    151.101.60.204 blog-fastly.herokuapp.com
                hosts file is /etc/hosts 
                then save
        
        * Testing your domain ++++++++++++++++skipped
                    ping blog-fastly.herokuapp.com
                should display Fastly POP address 151.101.56.204
                Be sure to remove the host entry from your hosts file 
                after you make CNAME changes to point your domain to Fastly.
 
 * test cURL
 
        * test case 1: use web interface 
            click "Configure" then click "Check Cache button"
            the window pop up do put 
                https://blog-fastly.herokuapp.com
                (or anything like https://blog-fastly.herokuapp.com/articles/4)
                it will show you the cache 
            
            If the content hash (Fastly-Debug-Digest) is different across nodes, 
            that usually indicates that there's a caching problem.
            ++++++++++++++ todo: ask
            I guess this is now called "Contect hash" under debug info column 
                out come was all fine all the same 
            
        * test case 2 : use cURL
        
            * simple cURL command 
                curl -svo /dev/null blog-fastly.herokuapp.com
                it shpould show someting similar to one below but nothing like that was print

                The Fastly-Debug header provides additional information
                Because surrogate keys are present, the Fastly-Debug header exposes them ++++++ what is surrogate key?

* Changing the TTL for the Article pages
        Here you must do extra steps:
        Click "configure" then click current version such as version1,
        Menu appears on left side but you cannot write anything unless you clone the current version from Option on right top corner
        So you can start developing the next version of it.
